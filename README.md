# wsbTickerCounter

Everything is self contained. Just download and run index.html

This will refresh comments based on refreshRate (line 41 index.hmtl) and keep track of what has been read. 

This doesnt use the reddit api as I was too lazy to set that up so it just attempts to read 4 reply layers deep, at 50 comments at a time.
